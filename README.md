# textapi
A basic python class for dealing with multiline text.

This module was created as part of a personnal project, a python/pygame based text editor.

Current implementation supports most basic editing operations such as cursor navigation (almost all keyboard shortcuts like directional arrows, HOME, END, PAGEUP, etc), text selection, and edition (insert and overwrite modes).

The implementation is not complete.
